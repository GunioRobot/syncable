Syncable
=========

#### Sync data items to HTML elements in real-time ####

This library allows you to sync collections of items with data on the HTML UI.
It does so by storing each item in JSON, and providing methods to update the elements.

Each collection is linked to an HTML element with a given ID, which is auto-detected.
Whenever you add, replace or delete elements, the DOM will be updated automagically.


Using Syncable
---------------

You just need to include the prototype, mustache and syncable js files into your HTML.
To learn more, it's better to take a look at the examples in the _examples_ folder.


Contributing
---------------

This library is in its infancy. Please contribute with your patches, examples and extensions.
